## Libraries For Developers

To be added shortly.

But now feel free to look at the source code in C#
as well as the [demo implementation](./CollectAlgorithm/demo.scm)
in the [Scheme] programming language.

The consumer library in Python is currently under construction.

## Programs For Users

Here is the [release x86 build](./PdbReader.exe).

It will not function without DIA.
But if you have Visual Studio development environment installed,
it is most likely that you also have DIA installed.

### PdbReader.exe Usage

```
usage: PdbReader action file [args]

actions:
list    output types list
xml     output xml data
def     output type definitions
```

### PdbReader.exe Usage Samples

To be added.

But you are free to play with it now.
