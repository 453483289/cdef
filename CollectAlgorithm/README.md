I invent an algorithm for complex structs' collecting in this project.

Here is a demo written in [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)).

I can guarantee its correctness in my application. Sorry, but no mathematicians, Ph.Ds or formal proofs here. If you can make a proof, please help.
